# An Analysis of Stock Performance

## Purpose: 

This is a technical analysis of the historical data of a set of stocks in the alternative energy sector. This analysis aims to evaluate the ticker symbol: DQ and its stock performance compared to other alternative energy sector stocks. To conduct our research, we focused on the following data points: Ticker, Price, Date, and Volume.

## Results:

In 2017 our target stock DQ had a yearly return of 199.4%. However, in 2018, the ticker symbol ENPH was the only stock to post a positive return.  Our target stock, DQ, provided one of the worst yearly returns, as seen below:

## Summary 

The most significant advantage of refactoring code, in my opinion, is that you can save time and complete tasks quicker. A disadvantage is that you may suffer from performance issues if the code is improperly customized to your needs. In the case of this project, refactoring the original code dramatically improved the performance of the application.
